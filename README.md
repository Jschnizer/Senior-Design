# Project Topic/Description
This project is an app that uses AI to come up with a playlist of music that is personalized to you and what you want to listen to at a given moment. Some factors that may influence this include:
 - Your listening history
 - Your mood
 - Your location
 - The weather
 - The time of day
 - Devices you are connected to (car, speaker, etc.)
 - A slider that determines how much new music you want to hear
 - Other factors
