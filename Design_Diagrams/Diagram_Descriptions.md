# D0:
  In this diagram, the user, represented by an oval, uses the app to achieve the goal, represented by a star, of creating a personalized spotify playlist based on their inputs.

# D1:
  This diagram is more detailed than the one from D0. This diagram shows the specific inputs, represented by rectangles, that the user will provide for the playlist to be created. These inputs include music specific elements (which can be BPM, dancability, genre, and key), mood factors (such as happy, sad, tired, etc.), and weather factors (such as current location temperature and precipitation).

# D2:
  This final diagram goes into the most detail of any of the diagrams. In addition to showing the different inputs like in D1, D2 also shows the process the user will need to go through while using the app to create their personalized playlist. They will need to access the app either through their computer or phone, then sign into Spotify to be able to link the app to their Spotify account. They will then provide the inputs as described in D1. After that, the diagram shows the process the app will complete to create the playlist. After the inputs are received, the app will process those inputs and pull data from the Spotify API and a weather API to finally create the personalized playlist, which will then be exported to Spotify.
