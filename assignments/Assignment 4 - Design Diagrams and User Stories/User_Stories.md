1. As a runner, I want the ability to quickly create a playlist of high tempo music that fits my tastes in order to keep me energized throughout a run.
2. As a student using spotify, I want a playlist with more relaxed music than I typically listen to without too many lyrics to help me focus while I study.
3. As someone on the move, I want to have a playlist that matches my current mood and interests well so that I don't want to have to regularly skip songs or manually select a song to listen to.
4. As an avid music listener, I want the ability to easily choose whether I want new music to listen to or music that I already know in order to have a varied listening experience.
