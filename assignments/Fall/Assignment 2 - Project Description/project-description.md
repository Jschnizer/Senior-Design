# Project Topic/Description
This project is an app that uses AI to come up with a playlist of music that is personalized to you and what you want to listen to at a given moment. Some factors that may influence this include:
 - Your listening history
 - Your mood
 - The weather
 - The time of day
 - A slider that determines how much new music you want to hear
 - Other factors 

This app is meant to be a companion app to Spotify. It generates music recommendations based on the listed factors and users can choose to add those recommendations to a playlist they can export to Spotify where they can to listen to it.

# Project Abstract/Problem Statement
Problem Statement: People want to listen to music without skipping songs they don't like. What people want to listen to at a given moment is determined by various contextual factors, and current tools do not exist to take these into account, either inside or outside Spotify. Therefore, our project aims to address the problem.

Abstract: SoundScape is an AI-powered playlist generation app that tailors music recommendations by analyzing listening history, mood, location, weather, time of day, and more. It lets users control how much new music they discover and accounts for the right context that may influence what someone wants to hear, creating a seamless listening experience that evolves with the userâ€™s context and preferences.

# Inadequacy of Current Solutions
Most current solutions to the problem are only personalized on the level that they give you song recommendations based on your listening history. Prime examples of this are Spotify's current soltuons, being the AI DJ and the AI playlist creator, whcih are widely considered to be problematic. For example, the AI DJ tends to talk a lot, recommend music that does not align with your listening interests, and switches up the feel of the music far too often.

# Technical Background Applicable to the Problem
Our team has some technical background that will be applicable to the development of this project, including app development, UI design, some familiarity with the Spotify API, and limited knowledge of AI.

# Our Team's Approach
Our team aims to implement a solution that is super personalized to the user. We want the user to decide how much new music they want to listen to, and how much they want to continue listening to music they've enjoyed recently. We also want to tailor the playlist to how the user is feeling and what they are doing while they are listening to music.
