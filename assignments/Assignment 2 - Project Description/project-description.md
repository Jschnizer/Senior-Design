# Project Topic/Description
This project is an app that uses AI to come up with a playlist of music that is personalized to you and what you want to listen to at a given moment. Some factors that may influence this include:
 - Your listening history
 - Your mood
 - Your location
 - The weather
 - The time of day
 - Devices you are connected to (car, speaker, etc.)
 - A slider that determines how much new music you want to hear
 - Other factors 

This app is meant to be a companion app to Spotify. It will come up with a playlist based on the listed factors and export this playlist to Spotify where the user will be able to listen to it.

# Project Abstract/Problem Statement
Problem Statement: People want to listen to music without skipping songs they don't like. What people want to listen to at a given moment is determined by various contextual factors, and current tools do not exist to take these into account, either inside or outside Spotify. Therefore, our project aims to address the problem.

Our project is an AI-powered music app that generates personalized playlists by integrating with the Spotify API. The app tailors music recommendations to each user’s preferences by analyzing various factors such as listening history, current mood, location, weather, time of day, and connected devices like cars or speakers. What’s unique about this app is how personalized the playlists will be that it creates. It lets users control how much new music they want to discover, blending familiar tracks with fresh selections and accounting for the right mood or timing that may influence what someone wants to hear. This app will aim to create a seamless listening experience that evolves with the user’s context and preferences.

# Inadequacy of Current Solutions
Most current solutions to the problem are only personalized on the level that they give you song recommendations based on your listening history. Prime examples of this are Spotify's current soltuons, being the AI DJ and the AI playlist creator, whcih are widely considered to be problematic. For example, the AI DJ tends to talk a lot, recommend music that does not align with your listening interests, and switches up the feel of the music far too often.

# Technical Background Applicable to the Problem
Our team has some technical background that will be applicable to the development of this project, including app development, UI design, some familiarity with the Spotify API, and limited knowledge of AI.

# Our Team's Approach
Our team aims to implement a solution that is super personalized to the user. We want the user to decide how much new music they want to listen to, and how much they want to continue listening to music they've enjoyed recently. We also want to tailor the playlist to how the user is feeling and what they are doing while they are listening to music.
